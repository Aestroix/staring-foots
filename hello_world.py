'''
THERE IS ONE MASTER BRANCH

BEFORE COMMITING THERE IS A STAGING AREA 
SO WHEN YOU MAKE A CHANGE YOU CAN ADD THAT FILE TO THAT STAGING AREA

git add <file> to add file to staging area
git rm --cached <file> to unstage

To commit make sure that you configure the git using your email and username

git config --global user.email "email"
git config --global user.name "username on git"

when you commit something the commit head goes above the latest added file

git branch <branch_name>: to add a branch
git checkout <branch_name>: to change branch
git merge <branch_name>: to merge a branch to current branch
